# Thoughts about the Process

Getting the Character's data to render correctly in real time was the biggest issue I have come across so far. It has really pushed me to deepen my understanding of React/Redux.

Right now, I am just using a static list of math problems, I need to create a function that randomly generates problems for me to give the User more questions to solve.

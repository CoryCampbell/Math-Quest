# Thoughts about the Process

Getting the Character's data to render correctly in real time was the biggest issue I have come across so far. It has really pushed me to deepen my understanding of React/Redux.

I really felt pleased with myself when I created a function that randomly generates questions for the user based on their current stage. I also increased experience gained to match the values of the answer of the current question, so experience gained values scale with your current stage as well. I need to figure out how implement a health system for the adventures to give more of a risk/reward experience for users who have missed questions and are starting to get low on health. And also I have enemies visually on the screen but there isnt really anything going on with them without a health system. Im thinking about changing some code to where the stage doesnt change until you get a question right, so you must answer 10 questions correctly to end the adventure.

Right now, I am working on implementing those changes to adventures. Afterwards, I will be working on adding a shop feature to add armor and items to the game!
